<h2>JavaScript</h2>

<p>JavaScript is a programming language commonly used in web development.
   It was originally developed by Netscape as a means to add dynamic and interactive elements to websites.
   While JavaScript is influenced by Java, the syntax is more similar to C and is based on ECMAScript, a scripting language developed by Sun Microsystems.
